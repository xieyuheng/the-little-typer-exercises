I found syntax error in file: 15.error.cic

 27 |      (j, head, tail, almost) => (j, equal) => tail
 28 |    )
 29 |
 30 |  aux(n, refl)
 31 |}
 32 |

Found the symbol "}" in [1279, 1280], while expecting:
 ":":
     sequence_entry:let_fn@152 -> (name: identifier)@153 "("@154 (bindings: bindings):bindings@157 ")"@158 > ":" (ret_t: exp) (sequence: sequence) optional
