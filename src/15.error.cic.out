I found syntax error in file: 15.error.cic


Found the number "0" in [3233, 3234], while expecting:
 ["identifier"]:
     operator:var@9 -> > (name: identifier) 
 "car":
     operator:car@9 -> > "car" "(" (target: exp) ")" 
 "cdr":
     operator:cdr@9 -> > "cdr" "(" (target: exp) ")" 
 and so on ...
