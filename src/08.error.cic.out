I am expecting the following two values to be the same (_: Nat) -> Nat.
But they are not.

from left hand side:
  (y) => add1(y)
to right hand side:
  (x) => nat_ind(x, (target_nat) => Nat, 1, (_prev, almost) => add1(almost))

08.error.cic:
 11 |incr(3)
 12 |
 13 |// NOTE `add(1)` is not equal to `incr` by reflection, we need to prove it.
 14 |the(Equal((Nat) -> Nat, add(1), incr), refl)
 15 |
