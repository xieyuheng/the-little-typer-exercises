# Definition of Judgment

> A judgment is an attitude that a person takes towards expressions.
> When we come to know something, we are making a judgment.

Thus, about a judgment, we can say:

- we have reason to believe `____`.
- we have no reason to believe `____`.

# Definition of "Form of judgment"

> A form of judgment is an observation
> with blank spaces in it, such as
>
> `____ is a ____.`

# Pair

``` cicada
check! cons("ratatouille", "baguette"): Pair(String, String)
check! refl: Equal(String, "ratatouille", "ratatouille")

check! refl: Equal(
  Pair(String, String),
  cons("ratatouille", "baguette"),
  cons("ratatouille", "baguette")
)

check! car(the(Pair(String, String), cons("ratatouille", "baguette"))): String

check! refl: Equal(
  String,
  "ratatouille",
  car(the(Pair(String, String), cons("ratatouille", "baguette")))
)
```

# Definition of Type

Expressions that describe other expressions are called types.

- Xie: When we can say "x is P", that means "P" describe "x".

This definition of type is very simple,
with a leading question, it is even more natural.

# Type

``` cicada

check! Pair(String, String): Type
check! String: Type
check! Type: Type
check! refl: Equal(Type, String, String)

check! Pair(
  car(the(Pair(Type, String), cons(String, "olive"))),
  cdr(the(Pair(String, Type), cons("oil", String)))
): Type

check! cons(
  cdr(the(Pair(Type, String), cons(String, "olive"))),
  car(the(Pair(String, Type), cons("oil", String)))
): Pair(
  car(the(Pair(Type, String), cons(String, "olive"))),
  cdr(the(Pair(String, Type), cons("oil", String)))
)
```

# The Four Forms of Judgment

```
(1)                   ____ is a ____.
(2)    ____ is the same ____ as ____.
(3)                   ____ is a type.
(4)  ____ and ____ are the same type.
```

Judgments are acts of knowing, and believing is part of knowing.

Judgments are sentence.

But, Sentences get their meaning from those who understand them.
The sentences capture thoughts that we have,
and thoughts are more important than the words we use to express them.
